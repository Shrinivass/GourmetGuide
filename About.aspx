    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>The main objective of the project is to make the experience of dining out and ordering food comfortable.
        The system provides features ranging from locating a restaurant to ordering food at the restaurant. 
        The system also provides an additional feature in the form of suggestions for the registered users, such as, suggestions for set of must-visit places of the town/city where the restaurant is located.</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>The model will provide a list of restaurants depending on the user’s search criteria. The user can select a particular restaurant from a list which will then provide the user a host of details about the restaurant. The user can choose to reserve a table or order the food online. A menu with a list of food items and specialities is displayed to the user to make a well-informed choice. In addition to this, user can reserve a parking space as well when reserving a table.</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>

<p>Various scenarios faced by the user motivated this project. Dining outside or ordering food from an eatery is a common phenomenon. However users are faced with various inconveniences. In today’s world, people seek instant results with the click of a mouse. Dining out is one of the most common ways of spending time for families, friends and couples. Therefore,the waiting time at restaurants for getting a table and ordering food has increased tremendously which is a major problem. Furthermore, the time for ordering food at the restaurant is longer and in some cases, the user expects a food from the menu but the restaurant does not provide it at that instant. Added to this, finding a parking slot at the restaurant is problematic. Our system aims at making these three things convenient for the user. Our system is unique in this way that it suggests based on user preferences, such as nearby places to visit like theatres, parks turning a dinner experience into a pleasant experience.</p>
